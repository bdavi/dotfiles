# My dotfiles and a few other things

## Note
Generally, this repo should be located at `~/code/dotfiles`. (You'll have the least friction using it if it's placed there.)

## Install dotfiles
Use `scripts/dotfiles/dotfiles install` or `scripts/dotfiles/dotfiles uninstall`.

You may override the default locations like this:
```
scripts/dotfiles/dotfiles install 'path/to/dir/containing/files/to/install' 'path/to/backup/existing/files/to'
```
